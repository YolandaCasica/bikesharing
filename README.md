# bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create visualizations in Tableau to help solidify a business proposal for a bike-sharing program. The bike-share analysis would be able to show the length of time that bikes are checked out and the rider genders. A time column was also added to see the number of trips for all riders by each hour of each day. The analysis would also show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
